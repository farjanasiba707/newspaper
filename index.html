    <h1>UK offers Hong Kongers citizenship in response to China</h1>
    <img src="image/uk.png" width="500">
    <p>Britain on Wednesday extended Hong Kong residents a broader path to citizenship in response to China's sweeping
        new security law for the former UK territory.

        Prime Minister Boris Johnson's announcement represents the most direct international response to legislation
        that has been roundly condemned by Western allies.
        It comes during a London review of its entire range of relations with Beijing that includes a reassessment of
        the role China's Huawei is playing in the buildup of Britain's 5G data network.

        "We stand for rules and obligations," Prime Minister Boris Johnson told parliament just hours after China made
        its first arrests in Hong Kong under the new legislation.

        "The enactment and deposition of this national security law constitutes a clear and serious breach of the
        Sino-British Joint Declaration."

        Johnson said London had warned Beijing that it would introduce a new route for those with British National
        Overseas status to move to the UK.

        "And that is precisely what we will do now," he said.

        About 300,000 Hong Kongers have BNO passports and another 2.6 million are eligible to apply.
        Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Britain's offer also extended to dependents of those with BNO status but
        refused to be drawn about how many would apply.

        Sky News and other media said Raab's office also summoned China's embassador Liu Xiaoming to express its deep
        concern.

        - 'Deeply disturbing' -

        Hong Kong was under UK jurisdiction until Britain handed it to China in 1997 with a guarantee that Beijing would
        preserve the city's judicial and legislative autonomy for 50 years.

        But critics say the new law -- passed by Beijing's rubber-stamp parliament this week without its text being
        released to the public -- tests the limits of the "One Country, Two Systems" principle that formally entered
        international law in 1984.

        Britain's last Hong Kong governor called details of the legislation unveiled overnight "even worse than I
        expected".

        "It is Orwellian stuff," Chris Patten told the BBC.

        "It does go wider and further than anybody had feared."</p>

    <p>Former captain of Bangladesh cricket team and incumbent MP of Narail-2 constituency Mashrafe Bin Mortaza has

        Result of the rest came positive today (Saturday).

        today. He has been found positive. He's now staying in isolation at home in Dhaka. Please pray for him,"
        Masrhafe’s younger brother Morsalin Bin Mortaza told media.

        Earlier on May 12, Mashrafe, an MP from Narail-2 constituency, sought an intensive care unit (ICU) for Narail
        Sadar Hospital from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to face the coronavirus crisis.

        He was working in his constituency during the pandemic.

        The country confirmed 37 more deaths from Covid-19 and 3,240 new cases of infection testing 14,031 samples in

    <h1>Three Pakistan cricketers test positive for coronavirus</h1>
    <img src="image/3ckr.png" width="500">
    <p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced Monday that three players have tested positive for coronavirus ahead
        of the team’s tour of England next month.

        The PCB said leg-spinner Shadab Khan, fast bowler Haris Rauf and teenage batsman Haider Ali had tested positive
        for COVID-19 despite showing no symptoms and would now go into self-isolation.
        The first Test against England at Old Trafford is due to start on August 5.

        The PCB is testing its players and officials ahead of the much-anticipated tour, which will also see games
        played in Southampton.

        Pakistan is experiencing a surge in coronavirus cases, with more than 180,000 so far including 3,590 deaths —
        though real numbers are thought to be much higher.

        The PCB also tested 23 players and 12 team officials Monday, with results due on Tuesday.

        Additional tests are planned for later in the week in Lahore, with only players testing negative allowed to fly
        to England.

        The PCB said anyone testing positive must remain in quarantine for two weeks.
        After that period, they will only be allowed to rejoin teammates in England following two successive negative
        tests.

        Pakistan players will also be subject to mandatory quarantine upon arrival in England, as per current British
        government regulations.</p>

    <h1>Violence against women still on</h1>
    <img src="image/woman.png" width="500">
    <p>Although Bangladesh made great strides over the years in gender equality and women empowerment, violence against
        women and girls remains a concern.

        Rights activists said though women are getting more opportunities in all spheres of life, much work needs to be
        done to combat violence against women and children.
        They also said a culture of impunity, bias of law enforcers and administration, social and political unrest,
        drug addiction and a lack of awareness are the major contributors to violence against women in Bangladesh.

        Women are also achieving enormous success in the workplace.

        Increased awareness and efforts in this region to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment have helped
        Bangladesh attain steady progress in those areas, which helped the country become the top performer among its
        South Asian neighbours in bringing down gender pay gap, according to a report of the World Economic Forum.

        Bangladesh closed 72.6 per cent of its overall gender gap and obtained 50th position out of 153 countries
        globally, the World Economic Forum said in its report titled ‘Global Gender Gap Report 2020’.

        Besides, the number of working women in Bangladesh increased to 18.6 million in 2016-17 from 16.2 million in
        2010—- a sign of increasing economical participation of women in the workplace.

        The government also increased the number of women seats in parliament and appointing more women in the Army,
        Navy, and Air force. Maternal leave has been increased to six months from the previous three months.</p>
